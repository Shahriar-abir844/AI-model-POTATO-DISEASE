# AI-model-POTATO-DISEASE
Overview
This repository contains a deep learning-based model for detecting and classifying diseases in potato plant leaves. The model accurately identifies whether a leaf is healthy, infected with Early Blight (Alternaria solani), or Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans). Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), this solution aids in early disease detection, enabling timely intervention to improve crop yield and reduce agricultural losses.

Key Features
✔ High Accuracy – Trained on a robust dataset to ensure reliable predictions.
✔ Multi-Class Classification – Distinguishes between Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight leaves.
✔ Scalable & Deployable – Can be integrated into web/mobile applications or IoT-based farming systems.
✔ Real-Time Inference – Fast prediction for use in field conditions.

Model Architecture
The model leverages a CNN-based approach (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, or custom architecture) trained on labeled potato leaf images. Key components include:

Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)

Deep feature extraction using convolutional layers

Classification head with SoftMax activation for disease probability
